# The Toeplitz Project English Translations Library

This is a place for English translations of mathematical papers written in
other languages.

Generally speaking, translations of theorems and proofs do not belong here.
Instead, these should be added to the
[lit](https://github.com/toepproj/lit) repo.

The present library -- called "En" for short -- is a place for translations of
"prose sections" of mathematical papers.
